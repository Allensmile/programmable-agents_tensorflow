" The agents learn to ground the terms in this language in their environment,
and can generalize their behavior at test time to execute new programs that refer to
objects that were not referenced during training. The agents develop disentangled
interpretable representations that allow them to generalize to a wide variety of
zero-shot semantic tasks." from the paper
